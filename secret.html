  <div class="poem fade-in">
    <p>Read this slowly. Let it enter like a breath you've been holding.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some days, you're not okay â€” and that's okay.</p>
    <p>You donâ€™t always have to be strong. Sometimes surviving is strength enough.</p>
    <p>Youâ€™ve been quiet for too long â€” I hope this space lets you feel heard.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your absence would echo louder than your silence.</p>
    <p>The world wonâ€™t always understand you, but this corner does.</p>
    <p>This void isnâ€™t empty. Itâ€™s filled with souls who feel too much.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If youâ€™re here reading this, maybe you just needed to know...</p>
    <p>â€” *You matter.* Even when you feel like a whisper in a storm.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer fade-in">
    <p>ðŸ–¤ You are not alone in the void. Weâ€™re all just trying to feel something real.</p>
